My name is Brian Tuovila and I live in Ann Arbor with my girlfriend and two 
female cats named Houdini and Major Tom. I am considering going to Eastern 
for a BA in Computer Science. I already have a BA in Psychology from U-M, so I 
wouldn't need to take that many credits at Eastern to get another degree, especially 
after getting an Associate's in Java from WCC. 
    
    I currently paint house interiors as a sole proprieter, sometimes with a helper or two. 
This pays the bills and offers me a flexible schedule while taking classes. I enjoy mountian 
biking (both trails and B2B pavement), x-country skiing, and disc golf.
