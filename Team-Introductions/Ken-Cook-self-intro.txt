Kenneth (Ken) Cook - A-Team Lead

My name is Ken Cook
I live in Ann Arbor with my wife an dour son.
I'm working on my associates degree in computer science in Java here at WCC and plan to graduate this May.
I hope to transfer to Eastern and earn a bachelors degree in computer science.

I enjoy cooking, playing games on my Nintendo switch, listening to music, and building electronic projects.

I work full time as a computer systems engineer for an automotive supplier with head quarters in the down river area.
The company has seven locations in the midwest

I have worked on many different programming projects, mostly as a single programmer. 
At work there are three of us that update and develop code for our main inventory control systems.

I was hired as a developer to write EDI translation software.
Currently I am responsible for all networking, email, and phone systems in the plants.
I am the lead linux admin, and co-admin for our VMware high availability cluster.
I still help with our EDI translator code and backup the main developer.

I have worked on one team project - five people writing a robot simulation and offline programming system for a custom Unix workstation.
We spent months designing the overall program and data structure, writing small prototype portions to verify our assumptions.
It was a multi-year effort.

I look forward to working with everyone on our team and hope we have a successful semester.
